\emph{``In this research process, attempt is to build a new interactive educational-product for students so as to inspire their interest in learning programming. The research objective in this thesis is an educational robot for students which can interact through visual programming. Two versions of the hardware platform is made available, one a ready made platform known as the Electric Ray Robot and another an easily buildable robot, known as the Inventor's Bot or InBot, thus giving a hands on experience in introductory robotics as well. A visual programming environment is also developed for desktop (MiniBloq) and mobile (InBlocks) devices to program the robots. An augmented reality simulation engine is integrated to the programming environment in a view to reach out to children with limited access to the hardware platforms. The results show that there is a promising and huge market potential to apply the new interactive technology to the development of educational robots.''}
