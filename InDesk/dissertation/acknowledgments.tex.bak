\emph{This work might never have been completed without the generous help and support of my supervisor, Prof. Madhav Rao, who was always eager to help and his door was always open for discussion. I would like to thank him for being my mentor during the past six months and for all those long discussions that we had. I thank him for introducing me to the field of visual languages and most importantly for teaching me how to convey ideas in writing.}

\emph{Last, and not the least, I would like to thank my family who have always supported me. Without their support, encouragement and love this work would have never been
completed.}
